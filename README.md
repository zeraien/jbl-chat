Let's set the stage, you are the founder of this exciting new messaging startup, you are tasked with building the first version of a product that is aimed to evolve with feedback from the team and users.

You're building the backend using Django, and your initial task is to leverage HTMX for interactive front-end experiences. With this first release, we want to deliver the following user stories:

1. As a user, I want to see all other users on the platform.
   1. As a user, I want to view my conversation with another user.
2. As a user, I want to be able to send messages to another user on the platform.

Given that this is your startup, you have the freedom to set up and utilize the practices that align with your goals. You can use any Python libraries or external tools that you prefer.

We have provided a Django skeleton project along with Docker setup for your convenience. Feel free to utilize Docker for development or Python virtual environments for your local setup. Since managing user registration isnâ€™t required for this assessment, you can create dummy users directly using the shell and implement session authentication.

Incorporating HTMX will allow you to create dynamic, interactive elements on the front end without needing to reload the page. We encourage you to think about how HTMX can enhance user interactions effectively.

Happy coding!
